# ETL on Olympics Dataset

A little ETL tool to put raw profile data into a sqlite database (hint it's included in the data folder)

## Description

Just before the Winter Olympics started the official site was still showing the summer games content. I found on the search page a json file with all the links to the profiles and quickly built a scraper based of that. I downloaded all the profiles to text files. This project's purpose is to practice my ETL skills.
